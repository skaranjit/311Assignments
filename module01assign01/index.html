<!-- After you improve this file, edit the following paragraph so that it describes what type of person you are, where you came from, and has a link within it for where we can go to learn more (recommended: a link to your LinkedIn profile). The following is a bad example - yours should be more detailed than the following. -->

<!-- At a minimum, you will need to change the values of the following to match you. You should add other information as you see fit. Note that if you follow the instructions correctly, you'll be putting this in a place that only you and the instructor have access to.

<!--
In class, you learned about how to put a file on puff.mnstate.edu and the various directories that are set up for you within there.

You are to put this there on puff.mnstate.edu at the following path:

/home/StarID/public_html/private/module01assign01

Where "StarID" should be replaced with your Star ID.

Then, as indicated in class, you should be able to access it, using a web browser on campus, using the following URL:

http://puff.mnstate.edu/~StarID/private/module01assign01

In order to do so, you'll need to log in using your MySQL username and password, which you can utilize the resources there in the "Class Mechanics" section of D2L Brightspace to help you figure out/adjust/reset as needed.
